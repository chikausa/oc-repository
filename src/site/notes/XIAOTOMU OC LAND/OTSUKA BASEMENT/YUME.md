A fashion model who despite her ice-cold demeanor, is really super admired by everyone around her. She has a reputation for being hard to work with, but mostly due to the fact no one can tell what she's thinking. She _also_ shares the sentiment by her brother that she thinks everyone's fucking stupid except him, but she has a very _special_ fondness for [[XIAOTOMU OC LAND/OTSUKA BASEMENT/MARIE\|Marie]], and often spoils her with cute clothing to see her bleed through it. Loves to steal eyes from her victims.
