A lab rat experimented on and shot up with some unknown chemicals that make his organs and body regenerate no matter what injuries occur. He'd be pretty much immortal, if not for the fact that the mass that's used to repair his wounds has to be replaced every day.

His pain and pleasure receptors are all messed up thanks to brutal torture from young. That being said, he's pretty terrified of pain.

> A quote about myself ~ ? There's nothing that important about me -- I'm just here to help Omi with his experiments and be by his side for the rest of my life! <3

> “Despite the cruel torture Yuki had endured, he is a sunny, lovely boy that embodies positivity and love for his friends and family. There’s nothing I won’t do to make Yuki happy, he is my blessing.”


### Appearance
Yuki is a bit on the small side, considering all the mass he loses on a regular basis. He has white hair that goes down to his neck, which he normally ties up into a little rat-like ponytail. He's a little skinny, and tends to wear big clothes that are more comfortable on him.

### Personality
Yuki is a generally sweet boy, who's a little addicted to self-injury. His penchant for pain is normally satisfied by [[XIAOTOMU OC LAND/OTSUKA BASEMENT/OMI\|Omi]]'s heavy hand (and experimentation), and he's honestly honored to be his experiment for the rest of his life. Before he was rescued from the facility, he was often very quiet, and only really learned how to speak from copying the people around him, so his accent is kind of all over the place. He's kindhearted, but can be a little eccentric and all over the place at times. 

He's completely devoted to Omi, and will do absolutely anything for him.

### History
Yuki was born into his family as [undecided name], the baby brother to [[REN\|Ren]], who treasured his baby brother with almost all of his life. One day, during a family trip to the theme park, Yuki was snatched away, and taken to the laboratory to be experimented on.

They tested several types drugs on him, combining in his system into his incredibly quick regeneration capabilities, and was always injured in various ways in order to see the process of how the cells would rebuild where it didn't seem possible. At first, it started scientific, and then slowly became an outlet for violence, with many of the other researchers just attacking and maiming Yuki for no reason. 

> [!caution]- TW: mentions of sexual assault, violence
> The amount of violence Yuki faced, and the constant pain he was in, eventually caused his brain to splinter and rewire itself to feel pleasure every time he felt pain, which resulted in the violence turning extremely sexual immediately. Around this time, Yuki was fucked everyday while being forced into increasingly more violent torture methods

This eventually lead to Omi destroying the laboratory and saving Yuki (and Marie) from the researchers.
