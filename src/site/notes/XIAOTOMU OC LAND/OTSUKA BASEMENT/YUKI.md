A lab rat experimented on and shot up with some unknown chemicals that make his organs and body regenerate no matter what injuries occur. He'd be pretty much immortal, if not for the fact that the mass that's used to repair his wounds has to be replaced every day.

His pain and pleasure receptors are all messed up thanks to brutal torture from young. That being said, he's pretty terrified of pain.

> A quote about myself ~ ? There's nothing that important about me -- I'm just here to help Omi with his experiments and be by his side for the rest of my life! <3

> “Despite the cruel torture Yuki had endured, he is a sunny, lovely boy that embodies positivity and love for his friends and family. There’s nothing I won’t do to make Yuki happy, he is my blessing.”


### Appearance
Yuki is a bit on the small side, considering all the mass he loses on a regular basis. He has white hair that goes down to his neck, which he normally ties up into a little rat-like ponytail. He's a little skinny, and tends to wear big clothes that are more comfortable on him.

### Personality
Yuki is a generally sweet boy, who's a little addicted to self-injury. His penchant for pain is normally satisfied by [[XIAOTOMU OC LAND/OTSUKA BASEMENT/OMI\|Omi]]'s heavy hand (and experimentation), and he's honestly honored to be his experiment for the rest of his life. Before he was rescued from the facility, he was often very quiet, and only really learned how to speak from copying the people around him, so his accent is kind of all over the place. He's kindhearted, but can be a little eccentric and all over the place at times. 

He's completely devoted to Omi, and will do absolutely anything for him.

### History
Yuki was born into his family as [undecided name], the baby brother to [[REN\|Ren]], who treasured his baby brother with almost all of his life. One day, during a family trip to the theme park, Yuki was snatched away, and taken to the laboratory to be experimented on.

They tested several types drugs on him, combining in his system into his incredibly quick regeneration capabilities, and was always injured in various ways in order to see the process of how the cells would rebuild where it didn't seem possible. At first, it started scientific, and then slowly became an outlet for violence, with many of the other researchers just attacking and maiming Yuki for no reason. 

> [!caution]- TW: mentions of sexual assault, violence
> The amount of violence Yuki faced, and the constant pain he was in, eventually caused his brain to splinter and rewire itself to feel pleasure every time he felt pain, which resulted in the violence turning extremely sexual immediately. Around this time, Yuki was fucked everyday while being forced into increasingly more violent torture methods

This eventually lead to Omi destroying the laboratory and saving Yuki (and Marie) from the researchers.

### Family + Relationships
###### [[REN\|Ren Lastname ]]
Yuki's long lost big brother. He has some fleeting memories of him, and when Ren finds him again, he really wants to take some time to get to know him! He wishes he knew what it would have been like to be his little brother...

###### [[XIAOTOMU OC LAND/OTSUKA BASEMENT/OMI\|Omi Otsuka]]
The love of his life, his savior, the person who he adores more than anything else in this world. Yuki would gladly and happily let Omi take him apart again and again as long as he could see him smile, even if one day his pain comes back.

###### [[XIAOTOMU OC LAND/OTSUKA BASEMENT/YUME\|Yume Otsuka]]
Omi's baby sister! She's very sweet, and kind, even if sometimes she could be a little scary. She takes good care of him and Marie, and Yuki can relate to her with how much they both love Omi so much.

###### [[XIAOTOMU OC LAND/OTSUKA BASEMENT/MARIE\|Marie]]
Marie is the closest thing Yuki has to a big sister! Since they were some of the few who survived the laboratory, and were rescued by Omi together, Yuki always sticks close to Marie. He cares about her a lot and worries about her sometimes as well, especially when she gets too anxious.

###### [[XIAOTOMU OC LAND/OTSUKA BASEMENT/ZETTA\|Zetta]]
His baby sibling! Well, sort of. He didn't get to spend that much time with them before Omi took down the operation, but he's happy they're safe, and has nothing but wonderful memories with them as well. Sometimes, he asks them to turn into silly anime characters from the animes he likes.

###### [[XIAOTOMU OC LAND/OTSUKA BASEMENT/RINA\|Rina Yamaguchi]]
He's not really *sure* about Rina, but she seems really nice, and he's glad that she took such good care of Zetta before they returned back to their family. She's a little squeamish, so Yuki can't help but want to cut himself open around her for giggles........

### Trivia
- *Looooves* to watch violent anime. A big fan of *Dokuro-chan*, though he doesn't know the plot at all.
- Can't read. Never learned to!
