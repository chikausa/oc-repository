A lab rat experimented on and shot up with some unknown chemicals that make his organs and body regenerate no matter what injuries occur. He'd be pretty much immortal, if not for the fact that the mass that's used to repair his wounds has to be replaced every day.

His pain and pleasure receptors are all messed up thanks to brutal torture from young. That being said, he's pretty terrified of pain.

### Appearance
Yuki is a bit on the small side, considering all the mass he loses on a regular basis. He has white hair that goes down to his neck, which he normally ties up into a little rat-like ponytail. He's a little skinny, and tends to wear big clothes that are more comfortable on him.

### Personality
Yuki is a generally sweet boy, who's a little addicted to self-injury. His penchant for pain is normally satisfied by Omi's heavy hand (and experimentation), and he's honestly honored to be his experiment for the rest of his life. Before he was rescued from the facility, he was often very quiet, and only really learned how to speak from copying the people around him, so his accent is kind of all over the place. He's kindhearted, but can be a little eccentric and all over the place at times. 

He's completely devoted to Omi, and will do absolutely anything for him.
